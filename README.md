# Movie-Recommender-system-Streamlit

<p>The Movie Recommender System is an intelligent Python application designed to enhance your movie-watching experience by providing personalized movie recommendations. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, natural language processing, and a rich dataset from TMDB (The Movie Database), this system helps you discover movies that match your preferences and taste.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Movie Similarity Analysis:</strong> The system calculates the similarity between movies using natural language processing techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation Engine:</strong> Users can select a movie, and the system will recommend five other movies that are similar in content and style.</li>
    <li><strong>Movie Posters:</strong> The system fetches movie posters dynamically, allowing users to see visual representations of recommended films.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The application preprocesses the movie dataset, extracting essential information like movie titles, descriptions, and genres.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Analysis:</strong> NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for text analysis. The movie descriptions are transformed into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.</li>
    <li><strong>Cosine Similarity:</strong> Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between movies based on their descriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation Generation:</strong> The system identifies movies similar to the user's selection and recommends the top five based on similarity scores.</li>
</ol>
